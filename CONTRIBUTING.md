Git workflow for team:
* Don't push to master
* Pull remote master, merge local / stay updated to master
* Write your own tests
* Name branches accordingly
* Write clear commit messages
* All PRs need independent review. Reviewer does merge, unless changes made. 

Style:
* User Airbnb styleguides for Ruby and JS
  - https://github.com/airbnb/ruby
  - https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
* Slightly more parentheses than necessary.
